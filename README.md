# MLOps for data scientists

This repository contains a small introduction to *machine learning operations* (MLOps) for data scientists. The four
core topics covered are:

* [Virtual environments](https://github.com/SkafteNicki/ku_devops/virtual_environments)
* [Version control](https://github.com/SkafteNicki/ku_devops/version_control)
* [Code testing](https://github.com/SkafteNicki/ku_devops/code_testing)
* [Experiment tracking](https://github.com/SkafteNicki/ku_devops/experiment_tracking)

For a much more complete set of material on this topic, see [this course](https://skaftenicki.github.io/dtu_mlops/)
which goes over the near complete pipeline of designing, modeling and deploying machine learning applications.

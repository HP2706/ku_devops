This repository contains a small introduction to *machine learning operations* (MLOps) for data scientists. The four
core topics covered are:

* [Virtual environments](https://github.com/SkafteNicki/ku_devops/tree/main/virtual_environments)
* [Version control](https://github.com/SkafteNicki/ku_devops/tree/main/version_control)
* [Code testing](https://github.com/SkafteNicki/ku_devops/tree/main/code_testing)
* [Experiment tracking](https://github.com/SkafteNicki/ku_devops/tree/main/experiment_tracking)

Why should a data scientist care of MLOps? Because MLOps provide processes and tools for creating *reproducible*
experiments at scale when working with any kind of machine learning models. Being able secure that your experiments
are reproducible are important in the context of the scientific method:

Without reproducibility the method breaks at the experimental stage, as non-reproduceable experiments will most likely
lead to different results and thereby different conclusions on the initial hypothesis.

For a much more complete set of material on this topic, see [this course](https://skaftenicki.github.io/dtu_mlops/)
which goes over the near complete pipeline of designing, modeling and deploying machine learning applications.
